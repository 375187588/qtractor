Qtractor - An Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer
----------------------------------------------

Qtractor is an Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer application written
in C++ around the Qt4 toolkit using Qt Designer.

The initial target platform will be Linux, where the Jack Audio
Connection Kit (JACK) for audio, and the Advanced Linux Sound
Architecture (ALSA) for MIDI, are the main infrastructures to
evolve as a fairly-featured Linux Desktop Audio Workstation GUI,
specially dedicated to the personal home-studio.

Requirements
------------

The software requirements for build and runtime are listed as follows:

  Mandatory:

  - Qt4 (core, gui, xml), C++ class library and tools for
        crossplatform development and internationalization
        http://www.trolltech.org/products/qt/

  - JACK Audio Connection Kit
        http://jackaudio.org/

  - ALSA, Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
        http://www.alsa-project.org/

  - libsndfile, C library for reading and writing
        files containing sampled sound
        http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

  Optional (opted-in at build time):

  - libvorbis (enc, file), Ogg Vorbis audio compression
        http://xiph.org/vorbis/

  - libmad, High-quality MPEG audio decoder
        http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/

  - libsamplerate, The secret rabbit code, C library
        for audio sample rate conversion
        http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/

  - LADSPA, Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API
        http://www.ladspa.org/

  - DSSI, An API for soft synth plugins with custom user interfaces
        http://dssi.sourceforge.net/

  - VST. Steinberg's Virtual Studio Technology
        http://www.steinberg.net


Installation
------------

The installation procedure follows the standard for source distributions.
Unpack the tarball and in the extracted source directory:

    ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    make

and optionally as root:

    make install

This procedure will end installing the following couple of files:

    ${prefix}/bin/qtractor
    ${prefix}/share/pixmaps/qtractor.png
    ${prefix}/share/applications/qtractor.desktop

Just launch ${prefix}/bin/qtractor and you're off (hopefully).

Note that the default installation path ${prefix} is /usr/local.

If you're checking out from CVS, you'll have to prepare the configure
script just before you proceed with the above instructions:

   make -f Makefile.cvs


Configuration
-------------

Qtractor holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.config/rncbc.org/Qtractor.conf . Normally, there's no
need to edit this file, as it is recreated and rewritten everytime
qtractor is run.


Bugs
----

Plenty still, after all this is alpha software ;)


Support
-------

Qtractor is open source free software. For bug reports, feature requests,
discussion forums, mailling lists, or any other matter related to the
development of this piece of software, please use the Sourceforge
project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtractor).

You can also find timely and closer contact information on my personal
web site (http://www.rncbc.org).
