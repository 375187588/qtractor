Qtractor - A MIDI/Audio multi-track sequencer
---------------------------------------------

Qtractor is a MIDI/Audio multi-track sequencer application written
in C++ around the Qt3 toolkit using Qt Designer.

The initial target platform will be Linux, where the Jack Audio
Connection Kit (JACK) for audio, and the Advanced Linux Sound
Architecture (ALSA) for MIDI, are the main infrastructures to
evolve as a fairly-featured Linux Desktop Audio Workstation GUI,
specially dedicated to the personal home-studio.

Installation
------------

The installation procedure follows the standard for source distributions.
Unpack the tarball and in the extracted source directory:

    ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    make

and optionally as root:

    make install

This procedure will end installing the following couple of files:

    ${prefix}/bin/qtractor
    ${prefix}/share/icons/qtractor.png

Just launch ${prefix}/bin/qtractor and you're off (hopefully).

Note that the default installation path ${prefix} is /usr/local.


Configuration
-------------

Qtractor holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.qt/qtractorrc. Normally, there's no need to edit this file,
as it is recreated and rewritten everytime qsampler is run.

Bugs
----

Plenty still, after all this is early alpha software ;)


Support
-------

Qtractor is open source free software. For bug reports, feature requests,
discussion forums, mailling lists, or any other matter related to the
development of this piece of software, please use the Sourceforge
project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtractor).


Enjoy.
